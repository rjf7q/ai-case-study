The company provides financial services such as estate planning in order to fund the lives of its stakeholders. It offers products and services that fulfill customers' financial needs and goals. DACA is the Deposit Account Control Agreement that serves as a legal contract for services between lenders and borrowers. It protects the lenders' interests and the borrowers' deposits.
PNC Bank is largely funded by loan, stock, and deposit services. For example, Q2 2024 revenue was about $5.4 billion. Average commercial and consumer loans had estimated value of $319.9 billion. Average investment securities had estimated value of $141.3 billion, primarily from U.S. Treasury securities.

## Landscape
PNC is a financial institution. Data analytics has been a consistently growing sector of opportunity for PNC to improve efficiency. The major hurdles have been how to document and classify the immense amount of data obtained. There is consistently a gap in data visualization that documentation cannot realistically capture. There are almost millions of data tables with full relationships too complex to understand. The data can consistently be incomplete and need pruning even with numerous validation rules. As much as solutions are projected to handle the majority of business cases, there will always be a need for new solutions as the market evolves.
PNC Bank ranks among the Top 10 largest banks in the United States according to total assets. Other larger financial institutions include JP Morgan Chase and Co, Bank of America, and CitiGroup.
